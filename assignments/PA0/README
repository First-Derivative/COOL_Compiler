 stack.test

    README this file

	atoi.cl is an implementation in Cool of the string to integer
	conversion function.

	stack.cl is the template file which you should fill in with
	your program.

	stack.test is a short test input to the stack machine.


Instructions
------------

    Make sure coolc and coolspim are on your PATH.

    To compile your program type

    % coolc stack.cl atoi.cl

	To run your program on a short test provided, type:

	% coolspim -file stack.s < stack.test

    Try it now -- it should work, and print "Nothing implemented"
    (among a few other things).
